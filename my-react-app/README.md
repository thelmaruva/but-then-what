# But Then What?: Thelmar's Final Year Project

This web app acts as a tutor for students using AI. Lecturers can enter in their question set and students then can see their question set with a terminal to enter their code and their queries. The Chatbot will reply with probing questions and hints instead of giving an answer, to help students think critically about the question at hand.
