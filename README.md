# But Then What?: Thelmar's Final Year Project

This web application functions as an AI-powered tutoring tool designed to support student learning. Instructors can input a custom set of questions, which are then presented to students alongside an integrated coding terminal for submitting their code and queries. Rather than providing direct answers, the chatbot engages students with guided prompts and thought-provoking hints, encouraging critical thinking and deeper understanding of the subject matter.
